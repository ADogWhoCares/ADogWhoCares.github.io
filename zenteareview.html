        <article class="main">
    <p>A genuine yixing might be the white whale of many tea enthusiasts, but it's an item that is simply out of reach for many. The cost and the scarcity of the clay (some would even consider genuine yixing to be extinct) push these teapots into the realm of luxury items.</p>  
    <p>Affordable machine/mold manufactured teapots made out of less famous clays have been on the market for years, now. Online retailers in China are usually stocked with hundreds of different examples, from a huge amount of different kilns and potters. 
    <p> Buying one of these teapots is always a bit of a gamble, you never know if it will pour well, if the clay is safe, if it will even arrive. 
    <b>This particular teapot is one of the better sub-Â£50 products I've used. It arrived quickly, and well packed, and has quickly become a teapot I reach for when I want to brew lighter oolongs.
    <b>The clay is highly vitrified (it even chimes when clinked), with none of the dusty odour of something stored in a damp warehouse. The lid fits well, and it pours cleanly. The small size is ideal for 1-2 people. Another thing I really appreciate is the large handle, many small capacity teapots are very hard to pour due to undersized handles.
    <b> It's also quite a good looking piece, the finish is a little rougher in texture than many teapots in this price range, possibly a highly grogged clay. It does not seem to absorb tea oils/flavours as much as some other pots I have, so it might be a good choice for brewing multiple kinds of tea.  <b> The dragon-egg shape accommodates most leaf sizes. The colour isn't classic yixing, but it looks nice enough. My example was a little darker than the picture.
    <p>
    I'd highly recommend this affordable teapot, it's well designed, made from good quality materials, and it makes good tea.
