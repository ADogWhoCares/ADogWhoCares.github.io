        leaf vessel is a website for tea, teaware, and niche music reviews. All reviews are independent and I receieve no compensation

        Why the weird name? Anything you can infuse tea in is a leaf vessel, and I just like the way it sounds.
        <P>
        I will add tutorials, a news section, and more content as I refine my development skills
