        <article class="main"><br> For over a year we've been without gigs, without acoustic open mic nights, without clubbing. 
            <br>Some fantastic performers have taken to Twitch, we can hardly get by without their music, and a lot of professional performers are struggling.
            <br>I'd like to take the time to show you a few of my favourites, who aren't quite as big as Deadmau5, but they are very talented, and very entertaining.
            <br>Click on the links, and pay them a visit!

    <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sabrinasoloshow" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><h4>SabrinaSoloShow</h4></a>
    Table-flippingly rowdy, with a huge repetoire. Sabrina is much too engaging for background listening.</b>
    The production values on her stream are amazing, if you're into getting drunk in a barn. And yelling. I can't recommend this one enough.</b>

        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/skratchbastid" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><h4>Skratch Bastid</h4></a>
        "Finally, a real DJ" were the first words in my head when I heard BBQ connoisseur/old school hiphop master Skratch Bastid.
        Lots of viewer interaction (you can even video party in his Discord), a massive vinyl collection, and some of the best deck skills anywhere.

    <div class="flexitem three">
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/beckyandcloud" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><h4>BeckyAndCloud</h4></a>
        French singer/songwriter couple, who often collaborate with friends. Some very nice gear (check out Cloud's Gibson parlour).
        These guys are obvious professionals, super polished performances, plenty of songs to request, and they're really friendly.

    <div class="flexitem four">
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gunselsenol" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><h4>Guns</h4></a>
        London DJ Guns is probably my favourite EDM streamer, and my go-to for beats. Her music shows a lot of variety (she has daily themed sets), and she has really high video production on her streams.
        Great workout music, and great chilling music.

    <div class="flexitem five">
        <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/feleeseeya" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><h4>Felicia Harding</h4></a>
        Professional singer-songwriter, with a great folksy nylon-string sound and an amazing voice. Her live learning sections are a treasure.
        Nice song request features, and very happy to talk to her audience. For the quality of her music, she doesn't get nearly enough viewers.
